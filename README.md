### A Machine Learning Pipeline for Laughter Detection on the ICSI Corpus

This repo is based on the laughter detection model by [Gillick et al.](https://github.com/jrgillick/laughter-detection) and retrains it on the
[ICSI Meeting corpus](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1198793)

The data pipeline uses [Lhotse](https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse), a new Python library for speech and audio data preparation.
